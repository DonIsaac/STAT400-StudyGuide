## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Most of Chapters 6 and 7 are missing, and help would
be *very* much appreciated. When contributing, please keep in mind that this
guide is supposed to be a reference, and therefore your explanations and formatting
should be as short as possible. Also, the two-column layout is a little finnickey,
and you may have to play around with the column breaks to get everything laid out
nicely.
